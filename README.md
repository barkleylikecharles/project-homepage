Description
--

In this first project assignment, we have to implement and develop an app called Dominate Your Day using some web tehnologies and other web production and development tools. This creates an opportunity for us to learn new and put in use our knowledge of front end web development. We use **HTML** structure , **CSS** code, **JavaScript** code and use some of the basic concepts of **Git** and *GitHub*. We develop our app by setting up our project in GitHub and link our Github repository with into our local repositories. From there, we use Git to maintain team work collaboration and to monitor team work effort or progress.
